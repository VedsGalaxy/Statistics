Studen Grade Prediction
I have used different models to accurately predict the grade of students. Below is the details of the project.

Overview

In Portugal, the secondary education consists of 3 years of schooling, preceding 9 years of
basic education and followed by higher education. Most of the students join the public and free
education system. There are several courses that share core subjects such as the Portuguese
Language and Mathematics. Like several other countries a 20-point grading scale is used,
where 0 is the lowest grade and 20 is the perfect score. During the school year, students are
evaluated in three periods and the last evaluation (G3 of Table 1) corresponds to the final grade.
This study considers data collected during the 2005- 2006 school year from two public schools,
from the Alentejo region of Portugal. Although there has been a trend for an increase of
Information Technology investment from the Government, the majority of the Portuguese public
school information systems are very poor, relying mostly on paper sheets. Hence, the database
was built from two sources: school reports, based on paper sheets and including few attributes
(i.e. the three period grades and number of school absences); and questionnaires, used to
complement the previous information.

Goal
The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education for a school
in Portugal, Europe. The aim is to predict student achievement and if possible to identify the key
variables that affect educational success/failure, using recent real-world data (e.g. student
grades, demographic, social and school related features) collected from reports and
questionnaires.

Proposed Architecture
From the two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese), one will be modeled under the
following methodologies:
i) Binary classification (pass - 1 / fail - 0)
ii) Regression, with a numeric output that ranges between zero (0%) and twenty (100%)
For each of these approaches, three input setups (e.g. with and without the school period
grades) and five DM algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear, Ridge and
SVM will be tested. Moreover, an explanatory analysis will be performed over the best models,
in order to identify the most relevant features.
